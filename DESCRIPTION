Description: Visualization of complex biological datasets is
    essential to understand complementary spects of biology
    in big data era.
    In addition, analyzing of multiple datasets enables to
    understand biologcal processes deeply and accurately.
    Multiple datasets produce multiple analysis results, and
    these overlappings are usually visualized in Venn diagram.
    bioplots is a tiny R package that generates a heatmap to
    visualize overlappings instead of using Venn diagram.
